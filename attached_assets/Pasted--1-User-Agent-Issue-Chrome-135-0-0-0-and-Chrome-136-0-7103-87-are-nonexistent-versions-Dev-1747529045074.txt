1. User Agent

Issue:
	•	Chrome/135.0.0.0 and Chrome/136.0.7103.87 are nonexistent versions.
	•	Device name is generic or invalid ("10" or "K").

Fix:
	•	Use real Chrome versions that match real Android releases (e.g., Chrome 121.0.6167.162).
	•	Include a real Android device model, like:

Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; SM-A125F) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.6167.162 Mobile Safari/537.36

2. Screen Resolution

Issue:
	•	Resolutions like 360x720 and 377x753 are either suspicious or rare.

Fix:
	•	Match known device screen sizes, e.g.:
	•	Moto G6: 360x740
	•	Samsung A12: 412x915
	•	Use device-specific DPI + screen dimensions.

3. Platform / CPU

Issue:
	•	armv7l, armv81 — while valid, missing detailed CPU model.

Fix:
	•	Include realistic navigator.hardwareConcurrency (cores) and match it with device specs.
	•	Some advanced spoofers simulate Qualcomm or MediaTek chip info via WebAssembly.

4. Canvas / WebGL

Issue:
	•	Canvas and WebGL use default or widely-known bot fingerprints (e.g., WebKit WebGL, "ANGLE" vendor).

Fix:
	•	Use hardware-accelerated canvas and WebGL data from real devices (e.g., extracted via Puppeteer on an actual phone).
	•	Match vendor/renderer to the real GPU:
	•	e.g. "Qualcomm Adreno (TM) 610" instead of generic "WebKit WebGL"

5. Fonts

Issue:
	•	Default fonts like Arial, Comic Sans, etc. — too basic.

Fix:
	•	Real Android devices have system-specific fonts (e.g., Roboto, Noto).
	•	Include device-specific fonts in fingerprint.

6. Plugins

Issue:
	•	Not available is okay for mobile, but always having nothing is a pattern.

Fix:
	•	If pretending to be desktop, include realistic plugin data.
	•	For mobile: leave as-is or simulate one WebView plugin if necessary.

7. Network (IP & Connection)

Issue:
	•	Using hosting IPs or commercial mobile proxies gives it away.

Fix:
	•	Use residential mobile IPs from real ISPs (e.g., MTN, Vodafone).
	•	Match IP geolocation to:
	•	Browser language,
	•	Timezone,
	•	Device locale.

8. Language & Timezone

Issue:
	•	Inconsistencies between IP location, timezone, and language stack.

Fix:
	•	Match all of the following:
	•	navigator.language
	•	Accept-Language header
	•	Timezone
	•	IP geolocation (country/city)

Example: If using MTN Nigeria IP:
	•	Language: en-NG
	•	Timezone: Africa/Lagos
	•	Accept-Language: en-NG,en;q=0.9

Summary: Key Changes to Make it “Real”

Element	Fix
User-Agent	Use valid Chrome + Android versions and real model
Screen size	Match real device dimensions
WebGL/Canvas	Extract real fingerprints from physical phones
IP address	Use real 4G/LTE mobile IP (not datacenter)
Timezone	Match to IP geolocation
Language	Match navigator.language, IP locale, and timezone
Fonts	Include Android-native fonts
Network Speed	Simulate realistic values (RTT, downlink)
Plugins	Accept null on mobile, but be consistent
